#### Exercise 4: Found Letterforms
Document at least 25 examples of the same letter in the environment. Your photos should be high qualityâ€”no pixelation or unintended blurriness. Find different type styles including uppercase, lowercase, italics, bold, serif, sans serif, etc. Crop each letterform to create a dynamic composition in a grid (with or without gutters or margins) of at least 9 images in a 7" square. Try taking the letterform to just before the point where it is no longer recognizable as a character. Consider how the individual crops work together. Pay attention to color relationships, the individual cropping, and the scale of the letters themselves. Think unity and variety: what will unify your nine images (material, size, color, type case etc) and what will provide variety?

* 7" square composition, printed and trimmed
