#### Exercise 1: Letter Croppings
On five 6" squares, present sections of a letterform that high­lights its unique char­ac­ter­istics, keeping in mind the contrast between form and coun­terform. Each of your crops will use a typeface from Adobe fonts that fits into one of the following typeface classifications: any serif, modern serif, slab serif, any sans serif, script, blackletter. Once you find a typeface that fits the appropriate category, select a letter and crop into it. The crop should ideally focus on one of the aspects that identifies that classification of type but could also focus on something unique about that specific letter. The original letter does not necessarily need to be recognizable but the specific characteristic you are looking at should. Include the name and designer of the typeface in 10pt Acumin Pro Bold (on Adobe fonts).

##### Requirements
* five 6" squares, printed & trimmed
